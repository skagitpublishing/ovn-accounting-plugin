# OVN Accounting Site Template
This is a site template example for [ConnextCMS](http://connextcms.com). It's based on the 
[RPiOVN repository](https://github.com/christroutner/rpiovn) used to create [RPiOVN.org](http://rpiovn.org).
The purpose of this example template is to show how to build a web application using ConnextCMS
and [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone) and different front end frameworks.

At present, the app uses Backbone.js as the front end framework. The application will be duplicated
using Vu.js, and then React.js, in order to show how to build the same app using different front
end frameworks but the same server-side software.

OVN stands for Open Value Network. This app allows for simple accounting and reporting of time
commited to software projects. It's originally based on concepts used in the [NRP valuenet accounting software](https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork)
used by [Sensorica](http://www.sensorica.co/).

# RPiOVN
RPiOVN stand for Raspberry Pi Open Value Network. This software creates a website with an app that let's members
log time spent on project work. It's essentially accounting software, with a focus on transparency and collaboration.

Code in this repository runs on top of [ConnextCMS](http://connextcms.com) is based on the 
[plugin-template-connextcms](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/plugin-template-connextcms) repository. You can see
